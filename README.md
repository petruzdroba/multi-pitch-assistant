# Multi-Pitch Assistant

A mobile application for tracking and analyzing multi-pitch climbing sessions using real-time altitude monitoring and event classification.

## üì± Overview

Multi-Pitch Assistant is an Ionic/Angular mobile application that helps climbers track their climbing sessions with automatic event detection. The app uses the device's barometer to monitor altitude changes and intelligently classifies climbing events such as falls, rests, and pitch changes.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Altitude Monitoring**: Uses device barometer for precise altitude tracking
- **Automatic Event Classification**: Detects falls, rests, retreats, and pitch changes
- **Session Management**: Start, track, and end climbing sessions
- **Event Logging**: Manual note-taking during sessions
- **Session History**: View and analyze past climbing sessions
- **Location Tracking**: GPS coordinates for session locations
- **Cross-platform**: Built with Ionic for Android and iOS compatibility

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Framework**: Ionic 8 with Angular 20
- **Database**: SQLite with Capacitor Community SQLite
- **Sensors**: Barometer for altitude, GPS for location
- **Platform**: Capacitor for native mobile functionality

## üöÄ Getting Started

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## üì± Usage

### Starting a Session
1. Open the app and tap "Start Climbing"
2. The app will begin monitoring altitude changes
3. Automatic event detection will classify your movements

### During a Session
- **Automatic Detection**: Falls, rests, and pitch changes are detected automatically
- **Manual Notes**: Tap the + button to add custom notes
- **Real-time Monitoring**: View altitude changes and events in real-time

### Ending a Session
1. Tap "End Climbing" to finish the session
2. Add session details (name, type, location, notes)
3. Session is saved to your history

### Viewing History
- Navigate to the Log tab to see past sessions
- Tap on any session to view detailed information
- Edit session details or add post-climb notes

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true
};
```

### Event Classification Thresholds
The app uses configurable thresholds for event detection:
- **Fall Detection**: Minimum altitude drop (default: 0.5m)
- **Rest Detection**: Maximum altitude change (default: 0.3m)
- **Noise Filtering**: Minimum change threshold (default: 0.5m)

## üìä Data Models

### Session
```typescript
interface Session {
  id: string;
  timeStart: Date;
  timeEnd: Date;
  events: ClimbEvent[];
  name?: string;
  type?: 'sport' | 'trad' | 'undefined';
  location?: { latitude: number; longitude: number };
  notes?: string;
  completed?: boolean;
  pitchCount?: number;
}
```

### Climb Event
```typescript
interface ClimbEvent {
  id: string;
  time: Date;
  altitude?: number;
  type: 'session-started' | 'session-ended' | 'fall' | 'fall-arrested' | 
        'pitch-changed' | 'rest' | 'retreat' | 'manual-note' | 'lead-started' | 
        'lead-ended' | 'second-started' | 'second-ended' | 'error' | 'belay' | 
        'barometer-reading';
  notes?: string;
}
```
